# Minotaur vs Robots
Plaform jumper game created using Phaser game engine, Javascript, Jade and Grunt.

The game is over when the Minotaur jumps on top of all flying Robots. Use arrows for controls, hold down to pass through the Robot and let off to use as a bounce. Collect diamonds for additional points.
